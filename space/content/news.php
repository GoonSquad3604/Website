<p>We competed at States in Saginaw at SVSU (Saginaw Valley State University). We played on Ford Field, where we placed 15th on the field. We were on the 3rd Alliance with the alliance captains The Gems team 4362 and Lightning Robotics team 862. Our alliance was able to win Ford Field, which was hard in itself, but we also went on to the State Championship. We played 5 matches. Luckily for us though, we won, and are now State Champions!

<h3>2/19/2019</h3>
<p>We completed our A-bot for the 2019 competition season. The bot was put in the bag at approximately 11:35 Eastern standard time. Before we bagged N tagged we weighed approximately 110 pounds with all of our components on the robot, except we did not have our hatch manipulator attached to the robot at the time.
