		In the shop, one of the most important things is safety. Without safety, people would be losing limbs left, right, and center. 
		That is why the Goon Squad comes prepared with a plethora of safety equipment, and two highly trained safety captains that know 
		how to use it all. Additionally, everyone on the team is trained, and certified in CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), and AED 
		(Automated External Defibrillator) in case someone ever becomes unresponsive, or passes out. Our safety captains insure our safety 
		by providing us with evacuation plans in case of a emergency and treat simple cuts, and bruises that we may get in the shop to
		make sure they do not get infected later. We have three safety captains; one being a veteran with 3 years of past experience, and two
		 being a rookies with it being their first year. Our lead safety captain won three URL safety stars in last years game two
		at qualifying events and one at worlds! The safety captains keep a log of all of the past injuries in our shop, to prove how safe
		we actually are. In conclusion, safety is one of the main priorities in our shop, and that is thanks to our great safety captains.
